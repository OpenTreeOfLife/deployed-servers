This setup uses ot3 for web2py browser app and ot9 for treemachine and taxomachine, ot12 for oti and phylesystem-api.

The curator on ot3 redirects to ot11 (development).

NOTE that the API and oti are using a dummy docstore (phylesystem-0), so we can build and test
the API without polluting the real docstore repo!
