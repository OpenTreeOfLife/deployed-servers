This setup uses ot16 for the main webapp and curator, and ot10 for everything
else. The phylesystem-api on ot10 is now using phylesystem-0.


EXPERIMENTAL:

The third `localhost.config` attempts to install just the main
webapps (ie, the devtree server) on the user's system, while using the active
devapi server, and therefore phylesystem-0 for its data. 

This is mainly intended to support testing client-side modifications, and also
as a proof-of-concept for using the deployment scripts in a non-Linux
environment.
