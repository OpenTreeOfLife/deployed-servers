This setup uses ot3 for web2py apps, ot9 for treemachine and taxomachine, and
ot6 for the Open Tree API and oti. 

NOTE that the API and oti are using a dummy docstore (hbf_phylesystem_test), so we can build and test
the API without polluting the real docstore repo!

CURRENTLY UNUSED: ot10 (alternate server for Open Tree API)
