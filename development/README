This setup uses ot11 for the main webapp and curator, ot12 (borrowed from the
'production' system) for treemachine and taxomachine, and ot10 for everything
else. The phylesystem-api on ot10 is now using phylesystem-1.

TODO: Consolidate all services on ot10? It looks treemachine and taxomachine
are installed there, and our use of ot12:
    $OPENTREE_NEO4J_HOST=ot12.opentreeoflife.org
...is just legacy cruft.
