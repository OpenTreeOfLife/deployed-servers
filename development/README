This setup uses ot3 for web2py apps, ot9 for all neo4j servers (treemachine,
taxomachine, oti) and ot6 for the Open Tree API. 

NOTE that the API and oti are using a dummy docstore, so we can build and test
the API without polluting the real docstore repo!

CURRENTLY UNUSED: ot10 (alternate server for Open Tree API)
